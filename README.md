# Maze-Solver #
A Very simple maze solver created using the Djikstra Algorithm

This code is written to work with the Freenove Micro Rover which runs on an arduino based controller. 
With the successful implementation, the rover will find the shortest way through a 4x4 Square grid and read from Start to finish alon that route.
